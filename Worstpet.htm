<p align="center">This is my worst pet. That's right, worst. I used to think having a Mechanical Squirrel was really cool, but it went bonkers. It started repeating some stuff about Malfunctions, and jumped on my head. After that, it nibbled at my hat! And it was during a family reunion, too! </p>
<p align="center">The Mechanical Squirrel is towards the top of the page, nibbling away at my hat. </p>

<p align="center">In case you're wondering, my extended family did find it a bit odd that i have so many pets that follow me around. But hey, the guy on the left in the picture is an alien, and we have a ghost on the far right, so I'm sure I'm thought of as pretty normal! </p>
