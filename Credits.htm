<p align="center">Yes, I admit the things on this site never really happened and it's all fake. But it sure was humorous to pretend! </p>
<p align="center">Credit deserves to be given where it is due, and so I must say that I did not create the 3 dimensional computer models used in creating my website. They are all created by Blizzard Entertainment, creators of the game &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot; They are both the owners and the creators of all the 3D models pictured on this site. I simply used the models because within their game, World of Warcraft, I have aquired all of these pets through various means and I thought it would be fun to make a website about them. </p>
<p align="center">However, I did use Adobe Photoshop Limited Edition to make it look like the pets were present in real life with me. I also used a combination of Fraps and Camtasia Studio 3 to record World of Warcraft and create a movie of my digital avatar running around with my Wolpertinger. I used Garage Band to produce the music for my song, and I did the vocals.</p>
<p align="center">All of the programs mentioned above have websites at which I'm sure you could purchase them, although Garage Band may be Macintosh only.</p>
